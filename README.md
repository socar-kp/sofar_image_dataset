# SOFAR-Image: SOcar dataset For Advanced Research

Please note that this dataset page is continuously updated.

## Description
This repository contains sample images and guidelines to acquire full access to the SOFAR-Image and other auxiliary datasets utilized in several papers submitted to the KDD 2022. In the section below, we illustrated the employed datasets in each paper. Please note that we could not publicize several images (i.e., Receipts, Contract Documents) in this public repository due to privacy-related regulations. Instead, for the reproducibility of our studies, we described the Google Survey Form URL to request full access to the dataset. If you submit a request via the form, we will share a download URL on the full dataset, which has been fully anonymized.

We are actively working on publicizing these datasets for academic society, our colleague researchers, and ML practitioners. Please keep tuned!

If you have any inquiries on this dataset, please raise Issues on this repository.
